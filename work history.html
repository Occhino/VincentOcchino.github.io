		<center><h1><u>Work History</u></h1></center>
		<p>My work history is relatively small; however, I have stayed an average of three and half years at any given company. I am a firm believer
		in putting in the time at a company that hires me and trains me. A company that hires me deserves my time. I have learned valuable skills during 
		my employment at both Carl’s Jr. and Orange County Jumpers.</p>
		
		<img src="Images/Carl's Jr..jpg" alt="Carl's Jr." style="height: 110px; width: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 5px;"><p style="text-indent: 0px;">I started at Carl’s Jr. right after I graduated high school in June 2006 as a cashier.
		I took orders from customers and delivered them to their tables if they were eating in. I made sure the dinning room was clean and customers had a
		clean table to sit at. Also, I would clean the restrooms. After about a year, I was promoted to shift supervisor. I worked the closing shift. I did
		the end of the day deposit and end of the day inventory count. I was the highest-ranking employee during the closing shift, which meant I was the one 
		dealing with any complaints and problems. After the Carl’s Jr. I worked at closed I was transferred to another Carl’s Jr., however, after a while I
		found myself unemployed.</p>
		
		<img src="Images/Orange County Jumpers.jpeg" alt="Orange County Jumpers" style="float: right; width: 300px"><p>I found out that Orange County Jumpers, a small family owned business, was looking for someone to work in its office. I was hired to answer the 
		phone and book bounce houses for customers. Also, to organize the warehouse and do other things like clean bounce houses. I was repeatably asked to 
		delivery bounce houses and do things outside of my job description while I was there. I routinely said yes. I am a team player and I wanted to help 
		the owner out, I know him personally. When I was ready to transfer I quite Orange County Jumpers to attend California State University Monterey Bay 
		(CSUMB). I could not do both since CSUMB is in Seaside, CA, about a six-hour drive from my hometown, Fountain Valley.</p>
