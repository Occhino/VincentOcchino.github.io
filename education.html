		<center><h1><u>Educational Background</u></h1></center>

		<p>I went to pre-school at Fountain Valley United Methodist Church. Then for kindergarten through seventh grade I went to Miola. 
		Afterwards, I attended Shoreline, a private Christian school, for eighth grade. Then I attended Fountain Valley High School, in Fountain Valley. 
		At Fountain Valley High School, I ran cross-country and track. I ran the one and two-mile races in track and field. My junior year of high school 
		I took a regional occupational program class that gave me hands on experience as a mechanic.</p>
		
		<p>I graduated high school in June 2006. Subsequently, I attended Orange Coast College (OCC), a community college, before transferring to California
		State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB). I graduated OCC in Spring 2015 and I expect to graduate CSUMB in Spring 2018.</p>

		<p>I have a background in accounting and finance. I received an entry level accounting certificate from OCC and at CSUMB my concentration is the
		financial analysis track of accounting.</p>
